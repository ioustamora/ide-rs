/// # Main IDE Application State
/// 
/// Central state container for the entire RAD IDE application. This struct orchestrates
/// all subsystems and maintains the overall application state. The design follows a
/// centralized state pattern where all major IDE components are owned by this struct.
/// 
/// ## Architecture Pattern
/// 
/// The IDE uses composition over inheritance, combining multiple specialized systems:
/// - **Component Management**: Manages the collection of UI components in the designer
/// - **AI Integration**: Handles asynchronous AI operations with proper task management
/// - **Panel Management**: Controls visibility and state of various IDE panels
/// - **Mode Switching**: Coordinates between design and code editing modes
/// 
/// ## Memory Management
/// 
/// Components are stored as boxed trait objects (`Box<dyn Component>`) to enable
/// polymorphic behavior while maintaining a homogeneous collection. This allows
/// for runtime component type determination and dynamic dispatch.
