//! # Process Manager Component
//!
//! A cross-platform process management interface for system process operations.
//! This component provides unified access to process listing, monitoring, and
//! control functionality across different operating systems.
//!
//! The process manager enables applications to interact with system processes,
//! gather process information, and perform process control operations while
//! abstracting platform-specific implementations.
//!
//! # Platform Support
//!
//! This component works across different operating systems:
//! - **Windows**: Uses Windows Process API (CreateProcess, TerminateProcess, etc.)
//! - **macOS**: Uses BSD process management and mach kernel interfaces
//! - **Linux**: Uses procfs, signals, and standard POSIX process operations
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - Cross-platform process enumeration and information gathering
//! - Process lifecycle management (start, stop, monitor)
//! - Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, handles)
//! - Process hierarchy and relationship tracking
//! - Signal handling and process communication
//!
//! # Security Considerations
//!
//! - Process operations require appropriate system permissions
//! - Elevated privileges may be needed for certain operations
//! - Process termination should be used carefully to avoid data loss
//! - Access control and permission validation for process operations
//!
//! # Current Implementation
//!
//! The current implementation provides mock functionality for development
//! and testing. A production implementation would integrate with system APIs
//! and process management libraries.
