//! # TCP Client Component
//!
//! An asynchronous TCP client for establishing network connections and data exchange.
//! This component provides a high-level interface for TCP socket operations,
//! abstracting the complexities of network programming while maintaining performance
//! and reliability.
//!
//! The TCP client supports both IPv4 and IPv6 connections, automatic reconnection,
//! connection pooling, and comprehensive error handling for robust network operations.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking I/O using async/await patterns
//! - **Connection Management**: Automatic connection establishment and lifecycle management
//! - **Data Transfer**: Efficient sending and receiving of binary and text data
//! - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with connection state tracking
//! - **Timeout Support**: Configurable timeouts for connection and read/write operations
//!
//! # Protocol Support
//!
//! - TCP over IPv4 and IPv6
//! - TLS/SSL encryption support (when enabled)
//! - Custom protocol implementations on top of TCP
//! - Binary and text data transmission
//!
//! # Use Cases
//!
//! - Client-server communication
//! - Microservice interconnection
//! - Database client connections
//! - Real-time data streaming
//! - Remote API access
//!
//! # Current Implementation
//!
//! The current implementation provides mock functionality for development.
//! A production implementation would integrate with tokio for async networking.
