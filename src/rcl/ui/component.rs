//! # Rust Component Library (RCL) - Core Component Architecture
//!
//! This module defines the fundamental `Component` trait that serves as the foundation
//! for the entire RCL component system. All UI components in the library implement this
//! trait to ensure consistent behavior and seamless integration with the RAD IDE.
//!
//! ## Design Philosophy
//! 
//! The RCL follows a trait-based component architecture that enables:
//! - **Polymorphism**: All components can be treated uniformly through the trait
//! - **Extensibility**: New components can be added without modifying existing code
//! - **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees about component behavior
//! - **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions with dynamic dispatch when needed
//!
//! ## Architecture Pattern
//! 
//! The component system uses the following pattern:
//! ```
//! Component Trait (this file)
//!     ↓
//! Basic Components (button, label, etc.)
//!     ↓
//! Advanced Components (chart, rich text, etc.)
//!     ↓
//! Custom Components (user-defined)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Integration with IDE
//! 
//! Components are stored as `Box<dyn Component>` in the IDE's component collection,
//! allowing for runtime polymorphism while maintaining a homogeneous container.
//! This design enables the IDE to work with any component type without knowing
//! the specific implementation details.

/// # Core Component Trait
/// 
/// The fundamental trait that defines the contract for all UI components in the RCL.
/// This trait serves as the foundation for the entire component architecture and
/// enables polymorphic behavior across different component types.
/// 
/// ## Design Rationale
/// 
/// The trait is intentionally minimal to:
/// - **Maximize Compatibility**: Any UI element can implement this simple interface
/// - **Enable Composition**: Components can be easily combined and nested
/// - **Support Dynamic Dispatch**: Components can be stored in collections and called uniformly
/// - **Facilitate Testing**: Simple interface makes mocking and testing straightforward
/// 
/// ## Implementation Requirements
/// 
/// All components must provide:
/// 1. **Identity**: A human-readable name for IDE integration
/// 2. **Rendering**: The ability to draw themselves in an egui context
/// 
/// ## Memory and Performance
/// 
/// - The trait uses `&mut self` for rendering to allow stateful components
/// - Name method returns `&str` to avoid allocations on each call
/// - The trait is object-safe, enabling `Box<dyn Component>` storage
/// 
/// ## Thread Safety
/// 
/// Components are not required to be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`) as UI rendering
/// typically occurs on the main thread. This simplifies implementation for most use cases.
#[allow(dead_code)]
pub trait Component {
    /// Returns the human-readable name of this component type.
    /// 
    /// This name is used throughout the IDE for:
    /// - **Component Palette**: Display name in the component browser
    /// - **Properties Inspector**: Component type identification
    /// - **Hierarchy View**: Tree node labels
    /// - **Code Generation**: Comment and variable name generation
    /// 
    /// ## Implementation Guidelines
    /// 
    /// - Use title case (e.g., "Text Box", "Chart View")
    /// - Keep names concise but descriptive
    /// - Avoid technical jargon in favor of user-friendly terms
    /// - Consider localization if supporting multiple languages
    /// 
    /// # Returns
    /// 
    /// A string slice containing the component's display name. The returned
    /// reference should remain valid for the lifetime of the component.
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    
    /// Renders this component within the provided egui UI context.
    /// 
    /// This is the core rendering method called by the IDE's rendering pipeline.
    /// The component should draw its visual representation using the provided
    /// UI context and handle any user interactions.
    /// 
    /// ## Rendering Responsibilities
    /// 
    /// The component implementation should:
    /// - **Draw Visual Elements**: Use egui widgets to create the component's appearance
    /// - **Handle Interactions**: Process user input (clicks, text entry, etc.)
    /// - **Update State**: Modify internal state based on user interactions
    /// - **Respect Layout**: Work within the allocated space provided by the parent
    /// 
    /// ## Performance Considerations
    /// 
    /// - This method is called every frame during active rendering
    /// - Avoid heavy computations; cache expensive calculations when possible
    /// - Use egui's built-in caching mechanisms for complex layouts
    /// - Consider using `ui.ctx().request_repaint()` for animations
    /// 
    /// ## Error Handling
    /// 
    /// Components should handle errors gracefully and continue rendering even
    /// if some operations fail. Consider displaying error states visually
    /// rather than panicking.
    /// 
    /// # Arguments
    /// 
    /// * `ui` - The egui UI context providing rendering capabilities and layout information
    /// 
    /// # Examples
    /// 
    /// ```ignore
    /// fn render(&mut self, ui: &mut Ui) {
    ///     // Simple text rendering
    ///     ui.label(&self.text);
    ///     
    ///     // Interactive button
    ///     if ui.button("Click me").clicked() {
    ///         self.click_count += 1;
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    fn render(&mut self, ui: &mut Ui);
}
