//! # Editor State Management
//!
//! This module provides centralized state management for the visual editor,
//! handling component selection, drag-and-drop operations, and user interactions.
//!
//! The state system tracks which components are currently selected or being
//! manipulated, enabling responsive UI updates and coordinated interactions
//! between different parts of the editor interface.

/// Central state container for the visual editor
/// 
/// Manages the current selection and drag-and-drop state for components
/// in the visual designer. This state is shared across the editor interface
/// to ensure consistent behavior and UI updates.
/// 
/// # Component Identification
/// 
/// Components are identified by their index in the component hierarchy.
/// This allows for efficient lookups and updates while maintaining
/// simplicity in the state management system.
/// 
/// # Thread Safety
/// 
/// This struct is designed to be used in a single-threaded context within
/// the main UI thread. For multi-threaded access, wrap in appropriate
/// synchronization primitives.
